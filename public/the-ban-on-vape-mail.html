The 2021 omnibus bill includes the “Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children Act,” which would make it illegal for a consumer to purchase any e-cigarette product online and have it shipped to them. The vape mail ban will be in full effect around the end of the first quarter of 2021.&nbsp;</span></p>

There are two parts to this bill that we should look at. Unofficially the “Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children Act,” was referred to by many as the “vape mail ban.” As its unofficial name suggests, the bill will indeed require the US Postal Service to establish regulations within 120 days banning U.S. Mail delivery of vaping products. This would mean that consumers would not be able to purchase and ship vapor products through USPS. In addition, the bill also forces nicotine and cannabis vaping products to comply with the&nbsp;</span><a style="background-image: initial;background-position: initial;background-size: initial;background-attachment: initial;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;color: #4a6ee0" href="https://www.atf.gov/file/102101/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking (PACT) Act</a><span style="color: #0e101a;background: transparent;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt" data-preserver-spaces="true">, which would impose stringent rules on online sellers. If the changes in policy are not followed within 90 days severe penalties will be issued, including up to three years in prison.</span></p>

                            <p>Sadly, lawmakers push policies under the guise of “protecting the children,” at the cost of tax paying adults. Ironically, the government tax-spending bill seems counter intuitive with addition of this act. While suffocating a tax-generating industry, lawmakers risk the health of their adult citizens by making safer nicotine products more difficult to purchase than cigarettes. With the going of USPS options for online sellers, private delivery services are being pressured to follow suit. Fedex is one of the first private mail services that has announced that changes to their mailing policy regarding vapor products will change during the first quarter of the new year. 2021 is starting out with one of the biggest changes in our industry and introduces us to a new era where a vape mail ban is a reality.</p>
